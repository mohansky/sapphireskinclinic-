It all seemed like to a good idea to have a tattoo. But people change, and the old tattoo just doesn't fit with your new image. Fortunately, we at Sapphire Skin Clinic have Qs Nd:YAG laser for tattoo removal.  It is painless safe and scar free. The total number of sittings required to remove the tattoo depends on the whether it is a professional or amateur tattoo and the type of ink used. Generally it takes 6- 8 sittings at monthly interval. We have devised a new technique to remove the tattoo in shortest possible time with no side effects.
