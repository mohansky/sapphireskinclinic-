Moles, warts, skin tags, are not dangerous or fatal, but they are embarrassing at least and cause low self-esteem which generate feelings of undesirability. Warts are small, harmless tumors most commonly caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).
Many people refer to a mole as any dark spot or irregularity in the skin. Some people are born with moles. Heredity also plays a major role in moles. They are usually brown in color and are of various sizes and shapes.
We use Electro Cautery, RF Removal, Laser Therapy, Cryosurgery depending on the condition and the site of the lesion.
