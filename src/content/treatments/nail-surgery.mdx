Nail surgery is the removal of all of the toenail or part of the nail. A local anaesthetic is used so that you will feel no pain during the procedure. After the removal of the nail, a chemical may be applied to the exposed nail bed to prevent re-growth by destroying the nail cells. (However, it is possible that some nail re-growth may occur). Healing takes between four to eight weeks.
