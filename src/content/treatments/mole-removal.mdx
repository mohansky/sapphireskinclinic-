Moles (nevi) are growths on the skin. Moles are very common. Most people have between 10 and 40 moles. A person may develop new moles from time to time, usually until about age 40.
About one out of every ten people has at least one unusual (or atypical) mole that looks different from an ordinary mole. Dysplastic nevi are more likely than ordinary moles to develop into a type of skin cancer called melanoma. Because of this, moles should be checked regularly by a doctor, especially if they look unusual; grow larger; or change in color, outline, or in any other way.
The removal of the entire mole or a sample of tissue for examination under a microscope is called a biopsy which is recommended for confirming melanoma.
There are various methods for removing moles. Some of the common methods used are Radiofrequency or Laser Excision. At Sapphire Skin Clinic we prefer to shave the mole and then excise. The method depends on the type of mole.
Typically, our dermatologist (a skin specialist) may choose excision with or without stitches, depending on the depth of the mole and the type of cosmetic outcome desired.
