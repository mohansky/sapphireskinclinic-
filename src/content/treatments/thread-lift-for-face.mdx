As one ages the underlying soft tissues of the face progressively lose their elasticity and volume. This results in the appearance of jowls along the jaw line and deepening of the the grooves extending from the corner of the nose to the corners of the mouth (naso-labial grooves). The Stitch Lift elevates these sagging tissues to refresh / rejuvenate the face. (note ~ stitch=thread=suture and Stitch Lift = Thread Lift = Suture Lift.)

The technique of stitch/suture/thread lifting has the advantages of being a minimally invasive procedure performed in rooms under light sedation and local anesthesia and producing subtle but significant changes.

Unlike an open facelift, it is not an extensive procedure, does not involve marked surgical interference with tissues or excision of skin and does not have the potential for significant complications that can accompany an open facelift.

The Stitch Lift is a minimally invasive procedure carried out under sedation and local anesthesia, taking around two hours to perform. Through a small incision in the crease behind the ear smooth, fine nonreactive threads (stitches) are inserted in a series of loops, extending towards the corner of the mouth and looping back to the ear. Here they are anchored into the tough fascia over the bone. Other loops extend more vertically from the upper sideburn area from tiny nicks hidden in the hair.

The effect not only lifts the sagging tissues, but also lifts the skin, smoothing the fine lines and wrinkles, the naso-labial folds, the corners of the mouth and the jaw line. The skin tightens into its newly held position. Over time collagen forms around the threads and so maintains traction on the soft tissues.
