PRP works on the simple basis is that of utilizing your own natural platelets to instruct the body to create new collagen for tauter, smoother and better-toned skin. Utilized in various ways, with or without fillers or with serums, the platelet solutions can be introduced with injections or by using an automated micro needling system.

PRP Rejuvenation incorporates fillers with PRP – which stands for Platelet Rich Plasma – to enhance the shape for the face and restore volume. It is a simple in-office nonsurgical procedure which uses a concentrated serum processed from your own blood in conjunction with dermal filler to increase the effectiveness and longevity of those fillers.

A small vial of blood is taken from your arm – less than that normally taken for routine blood tests. The blood is then placed in a vial and spun in a centrifuge to separate the red blood cells and plasma. The process concentrates the platelet count to about 4X normal. It is this platelet-rich plasma – often called “liquid gold” – that is then activated and injected into the skin – or applied topically in a surface regeneration action.

The serum is activated by the addition of simple calcium chloride. The activated plasma serum behaves the same way the body would respond if there were an actual injury – healing platelets rush in to create a rich fibrin mesh. This fibrin mesh in turn calls out to natural healing cells, releasing growth factors* and stimulating the process of fibroblast production to energize and heal.
