# DIODE LASER HAIR REDUCTION

Sakura Diode Laser hair removal is the #1 non-invasive aesthetics treatments available today with an estimated growth rate of 18%. With nearly 3.1 million laser hair removal treatments performed in 2006 alone, hair removal is a fantastic way to inject profit into your practice. While there are many methods to eliminate unwanted hair, very few can eliminate hair re-growth while leaving the surrounding skin undamaged. And photoepilation is quickly becoming the most popular. Lasers and light sources use the principle of selective photothermolysis to eliminate hair and its potential re-growth without damaging the surrounding skin. During a laser hair removal treatment, light passes through the skin and is absorbed by the melanin in the hair shaft. This absorption raises the temperature of the hair follicle and thermally destroys the cells responsible for re-growth. The attributes of the light (wavelength, pulse duration and power) are chosen to ensure damage to these cells and not to the rest of the skin.
