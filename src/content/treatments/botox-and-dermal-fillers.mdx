Botox reduces the activity of the muscles that cause wrinkles such as frown lines, worry lines and crow's feet.  Botox works by temporarily blocking the signals from the nerves to the muscles, thereby reducing muscle movement and causing wrinkles to relax and soften. Botox is also used by experienced injectors to lift areas of the face and extend the life of some dermal filler applications.  BOTOX is quick-acting, with results typically visible within 3-5 days, and lasting for 3-6 months. BOTOX can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatments.

Dermal fillers, on the other hand, are a range of products that fill depleted facial features, and in many instances stimulate collagen growth.  Advanced dermal fillers include Juvederm, Radiesse, Perlane, Restylane, Sculptra and ArteFill. Although each dermal filler has unique attributes, in general, most dermal fillers work in two ways. First, most of the fillers plump and lift the skin gently to replace collagen loss caused by the natural aging process. Secondly, most of the fillers also stimulate the body to produce its own natural collagen; some help more than others. Physicians use dermal fillers in a variety of ways to lift features of the face, correct wrinkles and to restore smoothness and volume to the skin. The effects of most fillers are nearly instantaneous.  Most of the dermal fillers last from several months to a year or two before touch up treatments are necessary to extend results.

Both BOTOX and advanced dermal fillers are effective treatments, with each having an extensive history of proven results. Both treatments are effective separately, however many physicians choose to use them in conjunction with each other to achieve optimal results.
