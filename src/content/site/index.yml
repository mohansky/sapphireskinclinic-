She first took a deep look at my skin after cleaning it to make sure she gives the correct advise later. The hydrafacial was super experience and the results were immediate. My skin already glows and I am definitely going back there again for a follow up. I rarely find places who give you full attention like this and for the complete full hour like the sapphire staff did.
